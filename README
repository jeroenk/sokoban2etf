Introduction

Translate Sokoban puzzles in xsokoban format into the etf format of LTSmin

Usage
-----

The Sokoban to etf translator can be invoked with:

    ./sokoban2etf <screen file>

where "screen file" is a file in xsokoban format. The translation to etf
is written to standard out. A copy of the puzzle is displayed on standard
error.

In addition to the above, the translator can be invoked with:

    ./sokoban2etf --optimize <screen file>

Using the optimize flag, some useless pushes of blocks are not generated.
In particular, blocks are not pushed into "corners" which are not also goal
positions. For example, this makes the following move illegal:

     #             #
    # $@    to    #$@

Moreover, blocks are not pushed into "alcoves" that do not contain a goal
position. This makes, e.g., the following illegal:

      @
      $           @
    #    #  to  # $  #
    ######      ######
